# Battleships

Welcome to my Battleships game.

Battleships is a strategy type guessing game whereby two players attempt to destroy the opposing players fleet of ships. They do this by alternating guesses of the coordinates of the concealed ships set out on a grid. 

This project uses the programming language of Python.

# Site Design Considerations

### User Expectations
- The game should be engaging for the player and clearly display a winner and a loser after each turn.


## Colour Scheme and Font

To provide an improved user experience and a point of difference I decided to implement a colour scheme to the game.
I hoped that this would provide a slightly more interesting visual experience for the player and also give a better definition to the functions when there are run.

 - Player input requests and messages in Purple colour (\033[1;35;10m)
 - Win messages in Cyan colour (\033[1;36;10m)
 - Lose messages in Red colour(\033[1;31;10m)

It was useful as it enabled me to clearly play out all the logic and possible sernarios to plan for the game
