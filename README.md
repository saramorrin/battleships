# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Welcome to my Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.

Most people are familiar with the basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but not everyone has heard of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game. This version of the game originated from the TV show, Big Bang Theory. This game adds 2 extra options, Lizard and Spock. The addition of these options changes the dynamic of the game providing the player with more variety and opportunity to win (and lose).

This project uses the programming languages of HTML5, CSS and Javascript.

# Site Design Considerations

### User Expectations
- The game should be engaging for the player and clearly display a winner and a loser


## Colour Scheme and Font

 

## Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser, table and a mobile browser format.

# Development Cycle

There were some elements I amended, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing and also made the game more responsive across all devices.

I also decided to include an additional button of 'Play Again' to allow the game to be reset after a winner has been declared.
